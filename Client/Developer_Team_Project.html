    <h1>Developer Team Projects</h1>
    
    <h2>Project 1: Weber's Team</h2>
    <p><a href="https://corbinwamz.github.io/wdd130-carterweber/">View Project</a></p>
    <p>I was Junior developer for this one, I made the games page.</p>
    <p>We communicated with teams, there were some troubles with communication but we got it done.

    <p>As for knowing what they expected for it, we just asked them</p>

    <p>And for mine contribute, I did contribute to all of them</p>

    <p>I did run into some problems when pushing to github</p>
</p>

    <h2>Project 2: Balazs's Team</h2>
    <p><a href="https://atkinsonadam.github.io/wdd130-balazs/">View Project</a></p>
    <p>I was the client for this one.</p>

    <h2>Project 3: Sucitta's Team</h2>
    <p><a href="https://adverak.github.io/wdd130-sucitta/">View Project</a></p>
    <p>I was the lead developer for this one. The client wasn't responding, so I tried my best to do what I could.</p>
    <p>.<p>
    <p>.<p>
    <p>.<p>

    <p>the most challenging part of this wasa the css</p>
    <p>I enjoy doing this, the HTML the the most enjoyable for me</p>
    <p>I would do more talking with the other people</p>
    <p>I would say yes, now that I know what it could look like in the real world</p>
